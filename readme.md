# How does this work?

It's a simple door entrance control based in arduino where you pass a card in the reader and, if it's a registered card, the door opens.

## You need 

* Arduino (i'm using uno)

* MFRC522 RFID reader

* RFID card/pin

* code editor (i'm using vs code)

* Arduino IDE
## How to use

In each case i'm showing what to do in its own paste. I recommend doing the python part the last since it needs the others.
